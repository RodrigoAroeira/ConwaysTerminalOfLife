## Introduction

This repository is a submodule of a challenges repository.
Today's task is to make a terminal version of Conway's Game of Life.

## Conway's Game of Life

### What is Conway's Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British
mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is said to be a
"zero-player game", meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state,
with no further input from humans.

### Rules

Traditionally, Conway's Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells,
where each cell can be either alive or dead. The state of the grid evolves when:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if
by reproduction.

## What's next?

For this project, I probably won't add any more features. I'm planning on creating
another project that will be a GUI version of Conway's Game of Life, with another
set of rules made on a 3-Dimensional grid.
